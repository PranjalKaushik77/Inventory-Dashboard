# Inventory Status Analysis & Dashboard

## Overview
The **Inventory Status Analysis & Dashboard** is a real-time inventory tracking system that helps businesses monitor stock levels and avoid shortages. The system categorizes inventory into different regions based on availability thresholds and allows users to directly email vendors when a part reaches the critical region. 

## Features
âœ… **Real-time inventory tracking** â€“ Monitor stock levels efficiently.  
âœ… **Threshold-based categorization** â€“ Inventory is classified into Safe, Warning, and Critical regions.  
âœ… **Vendor communication** â€“ Users can directly email vendors if stock is in the critical region.  
âœ… **Interactive dashboard** â€“ A clean and user-friendly UI for easy navigation.  
âœ… **Separate frontend and backend** â€“ Designed for modularity and performance.  

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js (React-based framework for fast UI rendering)
- **Backend:** Python (Handles data processing and API calls)
- **Deployment:** Cloud-based hosting for accessibility and scalability
