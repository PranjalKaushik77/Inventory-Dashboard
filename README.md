âœ… **Threshold-based categorization** â€“ Inventory is classified into Safe, Warning, and Critical regions.  
âœ… **Vendor communication** â€“ Users can directly email vendors if stock is in the critical region.  
âœ… **Interactive dashboard** â€“ A clean and user-friendly UI for easy navigation.  
âœ… **Separate frontend and backend** â€“ Designed for modularity and performance.
